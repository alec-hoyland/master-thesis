    the one that heralds new discoveries, \\

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Thank you to everyone I have forced into a conversation about neuroscience with me, namely Aparna Baskaran, Lishibanya Mohapatra, Mara Chin-Purcell Rue, and Ekaterina Morozova. Thank you as well to Srinivas Gorur-Shandilya, without whom this thesis would not have been possible. Thank you to Jan\'e Kondev, Eve Marder, and the Quantitative Biology Research Community for encouraging me to explore without bounds.

I also owe a great debt to my family: Jeffrey, Randi, and Sienna, and my adoptive family: Matthew, Deborah, Gwendolyn, Vanna de Graaff the keeshond, Norman the hedgehog, and Frederick and Boris the tortoises.
