  abstract = {Central pattern generators are neuronal circuits that when activated can produce rhythmic motor patterns such as walking, breathing, flying, and swimming in the absence of sensory or descending inputs that carry specific timing information. General principles of the organization of these circuits and their control by higher brain centers have come from the study of smaller circuits found in invertebrates. Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuro-modulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

\item 

The fundamental variables of small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmission, including the potential degrees of freedom at particular presynaptic and postsynaptic profiles, and the impact of presynaptic neuron firing rate, modulatory state and extracellular peptidase activity, act to increase the complexity of synaptic transmission.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

There is considerable diversity in the consequences for synaptic transmission resulting from small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmission at identified synapses, and their impact on behaviour. One highlight is that the various mechanisms by which this co-transmission influences synapses (for example, convergent or divergent co-transmission, firing rate-dependent co-transmitter release, and so on) are shared across invertebrate and vertebrate species.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Using exogenously applied neuropeptides has provided many insights into their modulatory actions, but this approach also has limitations and can lead to erroneous conclusions, as illustrated by studies in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion that compare the influence of exogenous versus neuronally released neuropeptides from identified neurons.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Extending small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmission studies from individual synapses to their impact on microcircuits, results from the crustacean stomatogastric system are presented to elucidate the impact of convergent versus divergent co-transmission, to separate regulation of co-transmitters and to show the distinct influence on the same microcircuits of different neurons with shared co-transmitters.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

Work from the stomatogastric system is also used to provide insight regarding the imperfect match between the influence of apparently equivalent, small-molecule\textendash{}neuropeptide co-transmitting neurons on the same microcircuits in different species.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$$<$/ul$>$$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Degeneracy, the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function, is a prominent property of many biological systems ranging from genes to neural networks to evolution itself. Because structurally different elements may produce different outputs in different contexts, degeneracy should be distinguished from redundancy, which occurs when the same function is performed by identical elements. However, because of ambiguities in the distinction between structure and function and because of the lack of a theoretical treatment, these two notions often are conflated. By using information theoretical concepts, we develop here functional measures of the degeneracy and redundancy of a system with respect to a set of outputs. These measures help to distinguish the concept of degeneracy from that of redundancy and make it operationally useful. Through computer simulations of neural systems differing in connectivity, we show that degeneracy is low both for systems in which each element affects the output independently and for redundant systems in which many elements can affect the output in a similar way but do not have independent effects. By contrast, degeneracy is high for systems in which many different elements can affect the output in a similar way and at the same time can have independent effects. We demonstrate that networks that have been selected for degeneracy have high values of complexity, a measure of the average mutual information between the subsets of a system. These measures promise to be useful in characterizing and understanding the functional robustness and adaptability of biological networks.},

We now report that proctolin depolarizes these cells maximally at membrane potentials close to the threshold for action potential generation. In voltage clamp, proctolin evokes an inward current, carried at least partially by Na+, that shows strong outward rectification. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ markedly increases the amplitude of the proctolin-evoked current and linearizes its current-voltage curve. The properties of the proctolin current make it ideally suited to contribute to the activity-dependent modulation of the pyloric network of the STG.},

One of these peptides, proctolin, activates an inward current that shows strong outward rectification (Golowasch and Marder, 1992). Decreasing the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration linearizes the current-voltage curve of the proctolin-induced current. We used voltage clamp to study the currents evoked by proctolin and five additional modulators [C. borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia), crustacean cardioactive peptide, red pigment-concentrating hormone, TNRNFLRFamide, and the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine] in stomatogastric ganglion neurons, both in the intact ganglion and in dissociated cell culture. Subtraction currents yielded proctolin-like current-voltage relationships for all six substances, and the current-voltage curves of all six substances showed linearization in low external Ca(2+). The lateral pyloric neuron responded to all six modulators, but the ventricular dilator neuron only responded to a subset of them. Bath application of saturating concentrations of proctolin occluded the response to CabTRP and vice versa. N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-napthalensulfonamide, a calmodulin inhibitor, increased the amplitude and altered the voltage dependence of the responses elicited by CabTRP and proctolin. Together, these data indicate that all six substances converge onto the same voltage-dependent current, although they activate different receptors. Therefore, differential network responses evoked by these substances may primarily depend on the receptor distribution on network neurons.},

We show here that each of these modulators acts on a distinct subset of pyloric network neurons in the STG. To ask whether the differences in cell targets could account for their differential effects on the pyloric rhythm, we systematically compared the motor patterns produced by proctolin and CCAP. The motor patterns produced in proctolin and CCAP differed quantitatively in a number of ways. Proctolin and CCAP both act on the lateral pyloric neuron and the inferior cardiac neuron. Proctolin additionally acts on the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, the pyloric (PY) neurons, and the ventricular dilator neuron. Using the dynamic clamp, we introduced an artificial peptide-elicited current into the PD and PY neurons, in the presence of CCAP, and converted the CCAP rhythm into a rhythm that was statistically similar to that seen in proctolin. This suggests that the differences in the network effects of these two modulators can primarily be attributed to the known differential distributions of their receptors onto distinct subsets of neurons, despite the fact that they activate the same current.},

Current-voltage curves also showed the response to be voltage-dependent, with a reversal potential at positive membrane potentials. The response was blocked in sodium-free solutions.

  abstract = {The Neuromodulatory Inward Current (IMI) of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in Cancer borealis is an inward difference current elicited by neuromodulators whose current voltage relation (IV curve) has been shown to be crucial to transitioning the pyloric network of this system from non-oscillating to oscillating states. Here, models of the second messenger signaling of both this current's activation and voltage dependence are constructed and tested. First, we examine how the proctolin receptor activates IMI with the hypothesis that it signals through an intermediate signaling component. This is tested by bath application and pressure injection of agonists and antagonists of second messenger systems and examining their effect on neuromodulator induced IMI. Consistent with this hypothesis, it is found that this proctolin-induced IMI is sensitive to modulators of G-protein function. Also consistent with this hypothesis, it is found that proctolin-induced IMI is sensitive to modulators of intracellular calcium concentration and calmodulin activated kinases. In contrast, there seems to be no effect to acute applications of pharmaceutical activators and inhibitors of cyclic nucleotides, Phospholipase C, and receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Next, we examine the mechanism of IMI voltage dependence that has been shown to be dependent upon extracellular calcium level and calmodulin signaling which we show is necessary for IMI voltage dependence by finding that application of calmodulin antagonists in normal calcium reduces IMI voltage dependence. However, it is found that calmodulin activators do not rescue IMI voltage dependence in low calcium so we propose that a Calcium Sensitive Receptor (CaSR) maintains IMI voltage dependence by active detection of extracellular calcium. This hypothesis is supported by several lines of evidence. First, IMI slope was increased by the specific calcium sensitive receptor antagonist NPS-2143 suggesting CaSR involvement. Second, IMI slope conductance was increased by exposure to the $\beta\gamma$-subunit inhibitor, gallein, suggesting that voltage dependence can be modulated by the $\beta\gamma$-subunit of trimeric g-proteins. Third, W7 induced linearization of IMI was reduced by pre-incubation of preparations with endocytosis inhibitors, suggesting that downregulation of a receptor is mediating W7 induced changes in IMI voltage dependence. Together, these results support the hypothesis that IMI voltage dependence is mediated at least in part by a CaSR-like G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR).},

When first plated in culture, these neurons had few active properties. After 1 d in culture they produced small action potentials that rapidly inactivated during maintained depolarization. After 2 d in culture they fired large action potentials tonically when depolarized, and their properties resembled very closely the properties of STG neurons pharmacologically isolated in the ganglion. After 3-4 d in culture, however, their electrical properties changed and they fired in bursts when depolarized. We characterized the currents expressed by these neurons in culture. They included two TTX-sensitive sodium currents, a calcium current, a delayed-rectifier-like current, a calcium-dependent potassium current, and two A-type currents. The changes in firing properties with time in culture were accompanied by an increase in inward and decrease in outward current densities. A single-compartment conductance-based model of an STG neuron was constructed by fitting the currents measured in the biological neurons. When the current densities in the model neuron were matched to those measured for the biological neurons in each activity state, the model neuron closely reproduced each state, indicating that the changes in current densities are sufficient to account for the changes in intrinsic properties. These data indicate that STG neurons isolated in culture change their intrinsic electrical properties by selectively adjusting the magnitudes of their ionic conductances.},

Fluctuations in temperature pose a problem to the nervous systems of poikilotherms because their body temperature follows the ambient temperature, thus affecting the temperature-dependent dynamics of various subcellular components that constitute neuronal circuits. In the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, the pyloric circuit produces a triphasic rhythm comprising the output of the pyloric dilator, lateral pyloric, and pyloric constrictor neurons. In vitro, the phase relationships of these neurons are maintained over a fourfold change in pyloric frequency as temperature increases from 7$^\circ$C to 23$^\circ$C. To determine whether these temperature effects are also found in intact crabs, in the presence of sensory feedback and neuromodulator-rich environments, we measured the temperature dependence of the pyloric frequency and phases in vivo by implanting extracellular electrodes into Cancer borealis and Cancer pagurus and shifting tank water temperature from 11$^\circ$C to 26$^\circ$C. Pyloric frequency in the intact crab increased significantly with temperature (Q10 = 2\textendash{}2.5), while pyloric phases were generally conserved. For a subset of the C. borealis experiments, animals were subsequently dissected and the stomatogastric ganglion subjected to a similar temperature ramp in vitro. We found that the maximal frequency attained at high temperatures in vivo is lower than it is under in vitro conditions. Our results demonstrate that, over a wide temperature range, the phases of the pyloric rhythm in vivo are generally preserved, but that the frequency range is more restricted than it is in vitro.},

Increasing robustness, so is proposed, can lead to the emergence of evolvability if evolution proceeds over a neutral network that extends far throughout the fitness landscape. Here, we show that the design principles used to achieve robustness dramatically influence whether robustness leads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant systems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially redundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly, the magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by differences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests that degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an important enabler of natural evolution.

\item 

Robustness is a ubiquitous feature of biological systems. It ensures that specific functions of the system are maintained despite external and internal perturbations. System control, alternative (or fail-safe) mechanisms, modularity and decoupling are the underlying mechanisms that produce robustness.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Robustness facilitates the evolvability of complex dynamic systems. Evolution, given enough time, might select a robust trait that is tolerant against environmental perturbations. This interlinks the properties of robustness and evolvability. Robustness is ubiquitous in biological systems that have evolved.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

There are specific architectural requirements for robust and evolvable systems \textemdash{} genetic buffering, robust modules and bow-tie architecture. These architectural requirements are the basis for the system's robustness against environmental perturbations, but congruent with genetic perturbations; they facilitate generation of a flexible phenotype.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Systems that are robust involve intrinsic trade-offs. Enhanced robustness against certain perturbations has to be balanced by extreme fragility elsewhere. This robust yet fragile nature, predicted by the highly optimized tolerance (HOT) theory, is a fundamental property of the system that has been optimally designed or has evolved to cope with perturbations. There are also other trade-offs in the system's performance and resource demands.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Diseases can be thought of in terms of the exposed fragility of robust yet fragile systems. The design of effective countermeasures requires proper understanding of a system's behavioural and failure patterns. \emph{Diabetes mellitus}, cancer and HIV infection represent the typical failure of such a system that requires systematic countermeasures to control robustness of an epidemic state. Countermeasures include systematic intervention to control a system's dynamics, attack fragility or introduce decoys to re-establish control.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$

\item 

Developing a theory of biological robustness with a solid mathematical foundation that can realistically represent biological systems is a difficult challenge. Research into non-linear dynamics, control theory and non-equilibrium theory is urgently required, but it has to be careful to capture the essential structural complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems.$<$/p$>$$<$/li$>$$<$/ul$>$$<$/p$>$},

Because neuromodulators can transform the intrinsic firing properties of circuit neurons and alter effective synaptic strength, neuromodulatory substances reconfigure neuronal circuits, often massively altering their output. Thus, the anatomical connectome provides a minimal structure and the neuromodulatory environment constructs and specifies the functional circuits that give rise to behavior.},

  abstract = {Neurons in cold-blooded animals remarkably maintain their function over a wide range of temperatures, even though the rates of many cellular processes increase twofold, threefold, or many-fold for each 10$^\circ$C increase in temperature. Moreover, the kinetics of ion channels, maximal conductances, and Ca2+ buffering each have independent temperature sensitivities, suggesting that the balance of biological parameters can be disturbed by even modest temperature changes. In stomatogastric ganglia of the crab Cancer borealis, the duty cycle of the bursting pacemaker kernel is highly robust between 7 and 23$^\circ$C (Rinberg et al., 2013). We examined how this might be achieved in a detailed conductance-based model in which exponential temperature sensitivities were given by Q10 parameters. We assessed the temperature robustness of this model across 125,000 random sets of Q10 parameters. To examine how robustness might be achieved across a variable population of animals, we repeated this analysis across six sets of maximal conductance parameters that produced similar activity at 11$^\circ$C. Many permissible combinations of maximal conductance and Q10 parameters were found over broad regions of parameter space and relatively few correlations among Q10s were observed across successful parameter sets. A significant portion of Q10 sets worked for at least 3 of the 6 maximal conductance sets ($\sim$11.1\%). Nonetheless, no Q10 set produced robust function across all six maximal conductance sets, suggesting that maximal conductance parameters critically contribute to temperature robustness. Overall, these results provide insight into principles of temperature robustness in neuronal oscillators.},

  abstract = {Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms that can be affected by activity. We present a model of a stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuron in which several Ca2+-dependent pathways are used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane currents in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca2+ sensors acting on different time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity approximately 90\% of the time. In these models, the same pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number of different time scales.},

The value of this important parameter remains controversial. In this study, Cm was estimated for the somatic membrane of cortical pyramidal neurons, spinal cord neurons, and hippocampal neurons. A nucleated patch was pulled and a voltage-clamp step was applied. The exponential decay of the capacitative charging current was analyzed to give the total membrane capacitance, which was then divided by the observed surface area of the patch. Cm was 0.9$\mu$F/cm2 for each class of neuron. To test the possibility that membrane proteins may alter Cm, embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were studied before and after transfection with a plasmid coding for glycine receptor/channels. The value of Cm was indistinguishable in untransfected cells and in transfected cells expressing a high level of glycine channels, indicating that differences in transmembrane protein content do not significantly affect Cm. Thus, to a first approximation, Cm may be treated as a ``biological constant'' across many classes of neuron.},

  abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

Despite these changes in size, intracellularly recorded membrane potential waveforms of pyloric network neurons and the phase relationships in the pyloric rhythm were very similar between juvenile and adult preparations. Across adult preparations, the cycle period and number of spikes per burst were not tightly maintained, but the mean phase relationships were independent of the period of the rhythm and relatively tightly maintained across preparations.

  abstract = {Dynamic-clamp is a fascinating electrophysiology technique that consists of merging living neurons with computational models. The dynamic-clamp (also called "conductance injection") allows experimentalists and theoreticians to challenge neurons (or any other type of cell) with complex conductance stimuli generated by a computer.  The technique can be implemented from neural simulation environments and a variety of custom-made or commercial systems. The real-time interaction between the computer and cell also enables the design of recording paradigms with unprecedented accuracy via a computational model of the electrode. Dynamic-Clamp: From Principles to Applications contains contributions from leading researchers in the field, who investigate these paradigms at the cellular or network level, in vivo and in vitro, and in different brain regions and cardiac cells. Topics discussed include the addition of artificially-generated synaptic activity to neurons; adding, amplifying or neutralizing voltage-dependent conductances; creating hybrid networks with real and artificial cells; attaching simulated dendritic tree structures to the living cell; and connecting different neurons.

To demonstrate an artificial voltage-dependent conductance, we simulate the action of a voltage-dependent proctolin response on a neuron in the intact stomatogastric ganglion. We show that shifts in the activation curve and the maximal conductance of the response produce different effects on the target neuron. 4. The dynamic clamp is used to construct reciprocal inhibitory synapses between two stomatogastric ganglion neurons that are not coupled naturally, illustrating that this method can be used to form new networks at will.},

While the forces that synchronize the flashing of fireflies may seem to have nothing to do with our heart cells, there is in fact a deep connection. Synchrony is a science in its infancy, and Strogatz is a pioneer in this new frontier in which mathematicians and physicists attempt to pinpoint just how spontaneous order emerges from chaos. From underground caves in Texas where a French scientist spent six months alone tracking his sleep-wake cycle, to the home of a Dutch physicist who in 1665 discovered two of his pendulum clocks swinging in perfect time, this fascinating book spans disciplines, continents, and centuries.

The intracellular calcium concentration acts as a feedback element linking maximal conductances to electrical activity. The resulting plasticity of intrinsic characteristics has important implications for network behavior. We first study a simple two-conductance model, then introduce techniques that allow us to analyze dynamic regulation with an arbitrary number of conductances, and finally illustrate this method by studying a seven-conductance model.

  abstract = {Conventionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

Here we quantitatively describe many features of the gastric rhythm of the crab Cancer borealis under several conditions. First, we analyzed spontaneous gastric rhythms produced by freshly dissected preparations of the STNS, including the cycle frequency and phase relationships among gastric units. We find that phase is relatively conserved across frequency, similar to the pyloric rhythm. We also describe relationships between these two rhythms, including a significant gastric/pyloric frequency correlation. We then performed continuous, days-long extracellular recordings of gastric activity from preparations of the STNS in which neuromodulatory inputs to the stomatogastric ganglion were left intact and also from preparations in which these modulatory inputs were cut (decentralization). This allowed us to provide quantitative descriptions of variability and phase conservation within preparations across time. For intact preparations, gastric activity was more variable than pyloric activity but remained relatively stable across 4\textendash{}6 days, and many significant correlations were found between phase and frequency within animals. Decentralized preparations displayed fewer episodes of gastric activity, with altered phase relationships, lower frequencies, and reduced coordination both among gastric units and between the gastric and pyloric rhythms. Together, these results provide insight into the role of neuromodulation in episodic pattern generation and the extent of animal-to-animal variability in features of spontaneously occurring gastric rhythms.},

Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases, but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it 'crashes' at extreme high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, while serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations.},

  abstract = {The modulation of the pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster Panulirus interruptus by the neuropeptide proctolin is described. First, the effects of proctolin on the pyloric motor patterns were characterized in terms of frequency and phase relations. Pyloric cycle frequency and lateral pyloric (LP) neuron activity increased and ventricular dilator (VD) neuron activity decreased with increasing concentrations (10(-9)-10(-6) M) of applied proctolin. Next, the effects of proctolin on the individual neurons that constitute the pyloric network were determined. Identified neurons were isolated from chemical and electrical presynaptic inputs by using pharmacological agents (Marder and Eisen, 1984a) and/or photoinactivation following Lucifer yellow injection (Miller and Selverston, 1979). Proctolin increased the amplitude and frequency of bursts produced by isolated pacemaker anterior burster (AB) neurons. Isolated LP and pyloric (PY) neurons responded to proctolin with increases in activity only when they were at or above threshold. All other pyloric neurons were unaffected. To determine how the direct effects of proctolin on isolated neurons resulted in the observed changes in frequency and phase relations in the motor pattern of the intact pyloric circuit seen in proctolin, individual neurons were deleted from the circuit. A comparison of proctolin's effects on isolated neurons with those on the intact network shows that the synaptic connectivity among neurons directly affected by proctolin and those unaffected by it shapes the network's response to proctolin.},

  abstract = {1. Results from the companion paper were incorporated into a physiologically realistic computer model of the three principal cell types (PD/AB, LP, PY) of the pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion. Parameters for the model were mostly calculated (sometimes estimated) from experimental data rather than fitting the model to observed output patterns. 2. The initial run was successful in predicting several features of the pyloric pattern: the observed gap between PD and LP bursts, the appropriate sequence of the activity periods (PD, LP, PY), and a substantial PY burst not properly simulated by an earlier model. 3. The major discrepancy between model and observed patterns was the too-early occurrence of the PY burst, which resulted in a much shortened LP burst. Motivated by this discrepancy, additional investigations were made of PY properties. A hyperpolarization-enabled depolorization-activated hyperpolarizing conductance change was discovered which may make an important contribution to the late phase of PY activity in the normal burst cycle. Addition of this effect to the model brought its predictions more in line with observed patterns. 4. Other discrepancies between model and observation were instructive and are discussed. The findings force a substantial revision in previously held ideas on pattern production in the pyloric system. More weight must be given to functional properties of individual neurons and less to properties arising purely from network interactions. This shift in emphasis may be necessary in more complicated systems as well. 5. An example has been provided of the value quantitative modeling can be to network physiology. Only through rigorous quantitative testing can qualitative theories of how the nervous system operates be substantiated.},

Each pattern corresponds to a specific behavioural situation: pattern 1 is only observed in unfed lobsters and feeding invariably produces a switch from pattern 1 to pattern 2 (Fig. 3). 3.The two pyloric patterns differ in the period of the cycle (Fig. 4), the burst duration of the constrictors (Fig. 5), the latency of firing of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 6) and the phase of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 7). Correlation between period and constrictor latency is weak in pattern 1 and strong in pattern 2 (Fig. 8). 4.The two pyloric patterns can be recorded from in vitro preparations only when the stomatogastric ganglion (i.e. the CPG) is connected to the more rostral commissural ganglia (Fig. 9). 5.At least in pattern 1, cycling of the constrictors can occur when the dilators (known as pacemakers in the CPG) are silent (Fig. 10). 6.For these reasons, we concluded that a commissural oscillator could be participating in the organization of the pyloric output. However, the synaptic relationships which exist between the motor neurones (i.e. the CPG) cannot be neglected (Fig. 11) and this suggests that, in the intact animal, the motor output is organized by the cooperation of a premotor oscillator and a motor oscillator.},

  issn = {0022-3077},
  abstract = {Rhythmic movements of the gastric mill and pyloric regions of the crustacean foregut are controlled by two stomatogastric neuronal networks that have been intensively studied in vitro. By using electromyographic recordings from the European lobster, Homarus gammarus, we have monitored simultaneously the motor activity of pyloric and gastric mill muscles for $<$/=3 mo in intact and freely behaving animals. Both pyloric and gastric mill networks are almost continuously active in vivo regardless of the presence of food. In unfed resting animals kept under "natural-like" conditions, the pyloric network expresses the typical triphasic pattern seen in vitro but at considerably slower cycle periods (2. 5-3.5 s instead of 1-1.5 s). Gastric mill activity occurs at mean cycle periods of 20-50 s compared with 5-10 s in vitro but may suddenly stop for up to tens of minutes, then restart without any apparent behavioral reason. When conjointly active, the two networks express a strict coupling that involves certain but not all motor neurons of the pyloric network. The posterior pyloric constrictor muscles, innervated by a total of 8 pyloric (PY) motor neurons, are influenced by the onset of each gastric mill medial gastric/lateral gastric(MG/LG) neuron powerstroke burst, and for one cycle, PY neuron bursts may attain $>$300\% of their mean duration. However, the duration of activity in the lateral pyloric constrictor muscle, innervated by the unique lateral pyloric (LP) motor neuron, remains unaffected by this perturbation. During this period after gastric perturbation, LP neuron and PY neurons thus express opposite burst-to-period relationships in that LP neuron burst duration is independent of the ongoing cycle period, whereas PY neuron burst duration changes with period length. In vitro the same type of gastro-pyloric interaction is observed, indicating that it is not dependent on sensory inputs. Moreover, this interaction is intrinsic to the stomatogastric ganglion itself because the relationship between the two networks persists after suppression of descending inputs to the ganglion. Intracellular recordings reveal that this gastro-pyloric interaction originates from the gastric MG and LG neurons of the gastric network, which inhibit the pyloric pacemaker ensemble. As a consequence, the pyloric PY neurons, which are inhibited by the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons of the pyloric pacemaker group, extend their activity during the time that PD neuron is held silent. Moreover, there is evidence for a pyloro-gastric interaction, apparently rectifying, from the pyloric pacemakers back to the gastric MG/LG neuron group.},

Subsets of these projection neurons can contain the same neuromodulator(s), yet little is known about the relative influence of such neurons on network activity. We have addressed this issue in the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis. Within this system, there is a neuronal network in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) that produces many versions of the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms. These different rhythms result from activation of different projection neurons that innervate the STG from neighboring ganglia and modulate STG network activity. Three pairs of these projection neurons contain the neuropeptide proctolin. These include the previously identified modulatory proctolin neuron and modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) and the newly identified modulatory commissural neuron 7 (MCN7). We document here that each of these neurons contains a unique complement of cotransmitters and that each of these neurons elicits a distinct version of the pyloric motor pattern. Moreover, only one of them (MCN1) also elicits a gastric mill rhythm.

In spite of the extensive literature documenting the presence of modulatory peptide co-transmitters in many neurons, considerably less is known about the specific roles of co-transmission in circuit function. This review describes some of the potential consequences of peptide co-transmission in functional circuits, using specific examples from recent work on the actions of identified peptidergic projection neurons acting on the multifunctional neural network within the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion. This system reveals that co-transmission provides projection neurons with a rich assortment of strategies for eliciting multiple outputs from a multifunctional network.},

  abstract = {The amines dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and octopamine (Oct) each elicit a distinctive motor pattern from a quiescent pyloric network in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG). We previously have demonstrated that these amines alter the synaptic strength at multiple, distributed sites within the pyloric network that could contribute to the amine-induced motor patterns. Here, we examined the postsynaptic contribution to these changes in synaptic strength by determining how the amines modify responses of pyloric motor neurons to glutamate (Glu), one of the network transmitters, applied iontophoretically into the STG neuropil. Dopamine reduced the Glu responses of the pyloric dilator (PD), ventricular dilator (VD), and inferior cardiac (IC) neurons and enhanced the Glu responses of the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons. The only effect of 5-HT was to reduce the Glu response of the VD neuron. Oct enhanced the Glu responses of the LP and PY neurons but did not affect the PD, VD, and IC responses. We also examined amine effects on the depolarizing responses to iontophoresed acetylcholine (ACh) in the PD and VD and found that they paralleled the amine effects on Glu responses in these neurons. This suggests that amine modulation of PD and VD responses to Glu and ACh may be explained by general changes in the ionic conductance of these neurons. We compare our results with our earlier work describing amine effects on synaptic strength and input resistance to show that amines act at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to modify graded synaptic transmission in the pyloric network.},

  abstract = {The crustacean pyloric Central Pattern Generator (CPG) is a nervous circuit that endogenously provides periodic motor patterns. Even after about 40 years of intensive studies, the rhythm genesis is still not rigorously understood in this CPG, mainly because it is made of neurons with irregular intrinsic activity. Using mathematical models we addressed the question of using a network of irregularly behaving elements to generate periodic oscillations, and we show some advantages of using non-periodic neurons with intrinsic behavior in the transition from bursting to tonic spiking (as found in biological pyloric CPGs) as building components. We studied two- and three-neuron model CPGs built either with Hindmarsh-Rose or with conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-like model neurons. By changing a model's parameter we could span the neuron's intrinsic dynamical behavior from slow periodic bursting to fast tonic spiking, passing through a transition where irregular bursting was observed. Two-neuron CPG, half center oscillator (HCO), was obtained for each intrinsic behavior of the neurons by coupling them with mutual symmetric synaptic inhibition. Most of these HCOs presented regular antiphasic bursting activity and the changes of the bursting frequencies was studied as a function of the inhibitory synaptic strength. Among all HCOs, those made of intrinsic irregular neurons presented a wider burst frequency range while keeping a reliable regular oscillatory (bursting) behavior. HCOs of periodic neurons tended to be either hard to change their behavior with synaptic strength variations (slow periodic burster neurons) or unable to perform a physiologically meaningful rhythm (fast tonic spiking neurons). Moreover, 3-neuron CPGs with connectivity and output similar to those of the pyloric CPG presented the same results.},

  abstract = {Organotypic cultures of the lobster (Homarus gammarus) stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) were used to assess changes in membrane properties of neurons of the pyloric motor pattern-generating network in the long-term absence of neuromodulatory inputs to the stomatogastric ganglion (STG). Specifically, we investigated decentralization-induced changes in the distribution and density of the transient outward current,I A, which is encoded within the STG by the shal gene and plays an important role in shaping rhythmic bursting of pyloric neurons. Using an antibody against lobster shal K+ channels, we found shal immunoreactivity in the membranes of neuritic processes, but not somata, of STG neurons in 5 d cultured STNS with intact modulatory inputs. However, in 5 d decentralized STG, shal immunoreactivity was still seen in primary neurites but was likewise present in a subset of STG somata. Among the neurons displaying this altered shal localization was the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron, which remained rhythmically active in 5 d decentralized STG. Two-electrode voltage clamp was used to compare I A in synaptically isolated PD neurons in long-term decentralized STG and nondecentralized controls. Although the voltage dependence and kinetics ofI A changed little with decentralization, the maximal conductance of I A in PD neurons increased by 43.4\%. This increase was consistent with the decentralization-induced increase in shal protein expression, indicating an alteration in the density and distribution of functional A-channels. Our results suggest that, in addition to the short-term regulation of network function, modulatory inputs may also play a role, either directly or indirectly, in controlling channel number and distribution, thereby maintaining the biophysical character of neuronal targets on a long-term basis.},

We used an optimization procedure to find neuronal morphological structures for two computational tasks: first, neuronal morphologies were selected for linearly summing excitatory synaptic potentials (EPSPs); second, structures were selected that distinguished the temporal order of EPSPs. The solutions resembled the morphology of real neurons. In particular the neurons optimized for linear summation electrotonically separated their synapses, as found in avian nucleus laminaris neurons, and neurons optimized for spike-order detection had primary dendrites of significantly different diameter, as found in the basal and apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. This similarity makes an experimentally testable prediction of our theoretical approach, which is that pyramidal neurons can act as spike-order detectors for basal and apical inputs. The automated mapping between neuronal function and structure introduced here could allow a large catalog of computational functions to be built indexed by morphological structure.},

  abstract = {Understanding the principles governing axonal and dendritic branching is essential for unravelling the functionality of single neurons and the way in which they connect. Nevertheless, no formalism has yet been described which can capture the general features of neuronal branching. Here we propose such a formalism, which is derived from the expression of dendritic arborizations as locally optimized graphs. Inspired by Ram{\'o}n y Cajal's laws of conservation of cytoplasm and conduction time in neural circuitry, we show that this graphical representation can be used to optimize these variables. This approach allows us to generate synthetic branching geometries which replicate morphological features of any tested neuron. The essential structure of a neuronal tree is thereby captured by the density profile of its spanning field and by a single parameter, a balancing factor weighing the costs for material and conduction time. This balancing factor determines a neuron's electrotonic compartmentalization. Additions to this rule, when required in the construction process, can be directly attributed to developmental processes or a neuron's computational role within its neural circuit. The simulations presented here are implemented in an open-source software package, the "TREES toolbox," which provides a general set of tools for analyzing, manipulating, and generating dendritic structure, including a tool to create synthetic members of any particular cell group and an approach for a model-based supervised automatic morphological reconstruction from fluorescent image stacks. These approaches provide new insights into the constraints governing dendritic architectures. They also provide a novel framework for modelling and analyzing neuronal branching structures and for constructing realistic synthetic neural networks.},

In vitro electrical recordings from these neurons have revealed a correspondingly diverse range of intrinsic firing patterns, including non-adapting, adapting and bursting types.

We show here, using compartmental models of reconstructed cortical neurons, that an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in a set of neurons that share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in their dendritic geometry. The essential behaviour of the model depends on partial electrical coupling of fast active conductances localized to the soma and axon and slow active currents located throughout the dendrites, and can be reproduced in a two-compartment model. The results suggest a causal relationship for the observed correlations between dendritic structure and firing properties and emphasize the importance of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function.},

To determine whether the changes in the currents are sufficient to produce the change in action potential duration and ionic dependence, we constructed a Hodgkin-Huxley model of electrical excitability of these neurons. The model shows that the equations describing the voltage- clamped currents of young and mature neurons generate action potentials appropriate in duration and ionic dependence for each developmental stage. Moreover, the observed changes in the currents are quantitatively sufficient to produce the changes in the action potential. The effect of the change in each current is detectable in the model. However, the increase in amplitude of the delayed-rectifier potassium current has the largest effect. The model further shows that changes in action potential duration could be achieved with changes in kinetics rather than amplitude of this current, or with changes in amplitudes of other currents. Thus, although increase in amplitude of the delayed rectifier plays a pivotal role in the maturation of excitability, it is not uniquely positioned to govern the action potential duration.},

We introduce a channel-based model for this neuron and show how bifurcation analysis can be used to investigate the response of this model to changes of its parameters. Two dimensional maps of the parameter space of the model were constructed using computational tools based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. Changes in the intrinsic firing and oscillatory properties of the model AB neuron were correlated with the boundaries of Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations on these maps. Complex rhythmic patterns were observed, with a bounded region of the parameter plane producing bursting behavior of the model neuron. Experiments were performed by treating an isolated AB cell with 4-aminopyridine which selectively reduces gA, the conductance of the transient potassium channel. The model accurately predicts the qualitative changes in the neuronal voltage oscillations that are observed over a range of reduction of gA in the neuron. These results demonstrate the efficacy of dynamical systems theory as a means of determining the varied oscillatory behaviors inherent in a channel-based neural model. Further, the maps of bifurcations provide a useful tool for determining how these behaviors depend upon model parameters and comparing the model to a real neuron.},

This technique can then be used to study in detail the excitability properties of the cell and the contribution each current makes to its general activity.
I identified seven time and/or voltage dependent conductances: a delayed rectifier current, a Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-activated outward current, an A-like current, a Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$ current, an inwardly rectifying current, a TTX-sensitive inward current, and a new voltage dependent current activated by the pentapeptide proctolin. Additionally, I observed three voltage independent currents: a leak current, a component of which may be Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-dependent and two GABA activated currents, one that partially resembles the known GABA\$$\backslash$sb\{$\backslash$rm B\}\$ activated current and another GABA activated cationic current. The proctolin activated current shows a voltage dependence that allows it to strongly influence the excitability of the cell in spite of its small amplitude.
The computer generated model cell shows the surprising result that the action potential termination in this cell is mostly due to the activation of the Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-activated current and not the delayed rectifier. It shows also how the relative contribution of each ionic current to the activity of the cell is modified when the peptide proctolin activates a separate, independent current. In the future this model could be used as the basis to explore the contribution of neuronal geometry to cellular activity.
I describe a cell culture protocol for Stomatogastric neurons and some preliminary electrophysiological data on these cells.},

  abstract = {The neurotransmitters mediating the synaptic interactions among the neurons of the pyloric system of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster, Panulirus interruptus, were examined using a combination of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and biochemical techniques. Iontophoretically applied L-glutamate inhibited all motor neurons of the pyloric system. This inhibitory response was blocked by low concentrations of picrotoxin but unaffected by atropine. The anterior burster (AB) interneuron, pyloric dilator (PD) motor neurons, and ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron were depolarized and excited by iontophoretically applied acetylcholine (ACh). The lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) constrictor motor neurons were inhibited by ACh and by the cholinergic agonist, carbachol. These inhibitory cholinergic responses were blocked by atropine but not by picrotoxin. The inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by the constrictor motor neurons were blocked by picrotoxin but not by atropine. Taken together with previously published data (15, 18), this suggests that the constrictor motor neurons release glutamate at both their excitatory neuromuscular junctions and their inhibitory intraganglionic junctions. The lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique (27) was used to study separately the neurotransmitters released by the electrically coupled PD and AB neurons. The AB-evoked IPSPs were blocked by picrotoxin but not by atropine. The PD-evoked IPSPs were blocked by atropine and other muscarinic antagonists but not by picrotoxin. Somata of PD neurons contained choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity, but somata of AB neurons contained no detectable CAT activity. On the basis of the data in this paper and previously published data (17, 18), we conclude that the PD neurons release ACh at both their excitatory neuromuscular junctions and their inhibitory intraganglionic connections. Although the AB neuron is electrically coupled to the PD neurons, the AB neuron is not cholinergic. Glutamate is a likely transmitter candidate for the AB neuron. These data show that electrically coupled neurons can release different transmitters. Furthermore, these data show that an IPSP can be the result of the combined actions of two different neurotransmitters, each released from a different neuron. The functional consequences of these conclusions are explored in the following papers (9, 22).},

  abstract = {1. The pyloric dilator (PD) and anterior burster (AB) neurons in the pyloric system of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion are electrically coupled and synchronously active. We have used the lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique to separate the connections made by the PD motor neurons from those made by the AB interneuron. 2. Photoinactivation of either the two PD neurons or the single AB neuron allowed us to separate the compound inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) motor neurons resulting from synchronous PD and AB activity into AB-evoked and PD-evoked components. These IPSPs have different time courses, reversal potentials, ion selectivities, and pharmacological properties. 3. Photoinactivation and membrane-potential manipulations indicated that a readily observable IPSP recorded in the AB neuron and correlated with action potentials in the LP neuron is actually an electrotonic potential due to an LP-evoked IPSP in the PD neurons. 4. Selective inactivation of either the two PD neurons or the AB neuron revealed that the IPSP recorded in the ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron is due solely to AB-released transmitter. 5. The electrical coupling potentials measurable between the AB, PD, and VD neuron somata are due to direct electrical coupling between all of these neurons. 6. Circuit analysis and transmitter identification may be complicated by electrical coupling. We suggest that the presence of electrical coupling between nonidentical neurons may provide a new mechanism that allows changes in synaptic characteristics among neurons within a "hard-wired" circuit.},

  abstract = {The notion that biological systems come to embody optimal solutions seems consistent with the competitive drive of evolution. It has been used to interpret many examples of sensorimotor behavior. It is attractive from the viewpoint of control engineers because it solves the redundancy problem by identifying the one optimal motor strategy out of many similarly acceptable possibilities. This perspective examines whether there is sufficient basis to apply the formal engineering tools of optimal control to a reductionist understanding of biological systems. For an experimental biologist, this translates into whether the theory of optimal control generates nontrivial and testable hypotheses that accurately predict novel phenomena, ideally at deeper levels of structure than the observable behavior. The methodology of optimal control is applicable when there is (i) a single, known cost function to be optimized, (ii) an invertible model of the plant, and (iii) simple noise interfering with optimal performance. None of these is likely to be true for biological organisms. Furthermore, their motivation is usually good-enough rather than globally optimal behavior. Even then, the performance of a biological organism is often much farther from optimal than the physical limits of its hardware because the brain is continuously testing the acceptable limits of performance as well as just performing the task. This perspective considers an alternative strategy called "good-enough" control, in which the organism uses trial-and-error learning to acquire a repertoire of sensorimotor behaviors that are known to be useful, but not necessarily optimal. This leads to a diversity of solutions that tends to confer robustness on the individual organism and its evolution. It is also more consistent with the capabilities of higher sensorimotor structures, such as cerebral cortex, which seems to be designed to classify and recall complex sets of information, thereby allowing the organism to learn from experience, rather than to compute new strategies online. Optimal control has been a useful metaphor for understanding some superficial aspects of motor psychophysics. Reductionists who want to understand the underlying neural mechanisms need to move on.},

The neurons fired tonically to depolarizing current steps, adapting to about 30\% of initial frequency along a compound exponential with time-constants around 0.3 and 3.5 s. 2. Both initial and final firing frequencies to depolarizing current steps were approximately logarithmic with current over a substantial current range (2\textendash{}10 nA). 3. Post-hyperpolarization rebound was exhibited by all cell types. Its magnitude was a linear function of current in some but not all cases. In simple cases build-up followed a compound exponential with time constants similar to those for adaptation. 4. Synaptic potentials were of two general types: sharprising (tpeak$\simeq$12 ms) and rounded (tpeak$\simeq$80 ms). 5. Effective synaptic strengths were measured between neuron types. In some cases the strengths were sufficient to expect complete shut-off of moderate activity in postsynaptic elements by moderate activity in presynaptic elements. 6.

The enhanced Ih electrophysiologically compensates for the enhanced IA, since pharmacological blockade of Ih uncovers the physiological effects of the increased IA. Expression of a nonfunctional mutant Shal also induces a large increase in Ih, demonstrating a novel activity-independent coupling between the Shal protein and Ih enhancement. Since IA and Ih influence neuronal activity in opposite directions, our results suggest a selective coregulation of these channels as a mechanism for constraining cell activity within appropriate physiological parameters.},

To explore the validity of this procedure, we studied the behavior of a conductance-based model neuron with five voltage-dependent conductances. We randomly varied the maximal conductance of each of the active currents in the model and identified sets of maximal conductances that generate bursting neurons that fire a single action potential at the peak of a slow membrane potential depolarization. A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

We explore the roles of conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models using a method that allows the explicit linking of HH model input-output behavior to parameter values for maximal conductances, voltage shifts, and time constants. The procedure can be used to identify not only the parameter values most critical to supporting a neuronal activity pattern of interest but also the relationships between parameters which may be required, e.g., limited ranges of relative magnitudes. 2. The method is the repeated use of stochastic search to find hundreds or even thousands of different sets of model parameter values that allow a HH model to produce a desired behavior, such as current-frequency transduction, to within a desired tolerance, e.g., frequency match to within 10 Hz. Graphical or other analysis may then be performed to reveal the shape and boundaries of the parameter solution regions that support the desired behavior. 3. The shape of these parameter regions can reveal parameter values and relationships essential to the behavior. For instance, graphical display may reveal covariances between maximal conductance values, or a much wider range of variation in some maximal conductance values than in others. 4. We demonstrate the use of these techniques with simple, representative HH models, primarily that of Connor et al. for crustacean walking leg axons, but also some extensions of the results are explored using the more complex model of McCormick and Huguenard for thalamocortical relay neurons. Both models are single compartment. Behaviors studied include current-to-frequency transduction, the time delay to first action potential in response to current steps, and the timing of action potential occurrences in response to both square-wave current injection and the injection of currents derived from in vitro records of excitatory postsynaptic currents. 5. Using these simple models, we find that relatively general behaviors such as current-frequency (I/F) curves may be supported by very broad, but bounded parameter solution regions, with the shape of the solution regions revealing the relative importance of the maximal conductances of a model in creating the behavior. Furthermore, we find that a focus on increasingly specific behaviors, such as I/F behavior, defined by tolerances of only a few hertz combined with strict requirements for action potential height, inevitably leads to increasingly narrow, and eventually nonphysiologically narrow, regions of acceptable parameter values. 6. We use the Connor et al. model to reproduce the in vitro action potential timing responses of a rat brain stem neuron to various stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The cable potential is expressed directly in terms of the impedance of the terminations and the cable electrotonic length. A computer program is given to invert the transform. Numerical solutions may be obtained for any particular model by inserting expressions describing the terminations and parameter values into the program, without further computation by the modeler. For a finite length cable, sealed at one end, the solution is expressed in terms of the ratio of the termination impedance to the impedance of the finite length cable, a generalization of the steady-state conductance ratio. Analysis of a model of a soma with several primary dendrites shows that the dendrites may be lumped into one equivalent cylinder if they have the same electrotonic length, even though they may vary in diameter. Responses obtained under voltage clamp are conceptually predictable from measurements made under current clamp, and vice versa. The equalizing time constants of an infinite series expression of the solution are the negative reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation. Examination of computed solutions shows that solutions which differ theoretically may be indistinguishable experimentally.},

  abstract = {Conductance-based neuron models aid in understanding the role intrinsic and synaptic currents play in producing neuronal activity. Incorporating morphological detail into a model allows for additional analysis of non-homogeneous distributions of active and synaptic conductances, as well as spatial segregation of electrical events. We developed a morphologically detailed ``Full Model'' of a leech heart interneuron that replicates reasonably well intracellular recordings from these interneurons. However, it comprises hundreds of compartments, each increasing parameter space and simulation time. To reduce the number of compartments of the Full Model, while preserving conductance densities and distributions, its compartments were grouped into functional groups that each share identical conductance densities. Each functional group was sequentially reduced to one or two compartments, preserving surface area, conductance densities and its contribution to input resistance. As a result, the input resistance and membrane time constant were preserved. The axial resistances of several compartments were rescaled to match the amplitude of synaptic currents and low-threshold calcium currents and the shape of action potentials to those in the Full Model. This reduced model, with intrinsic conductances, matched the activity of the Full Model for a variety of simulated current-clamp and voltage-clamp data. Because surface area and conductance distribution of the functional groups of the Full Model were maintained, parameter changes introduced into the reduced model can be directly translated to the Full Model. Thus, our computationally efficient reduced morphology model can be used as a tool for exploring the parameter space of the Full Model and in network simulations.},

Applying this approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence towards peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.},

Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

Even after about 40 years of intensive studies, the rhythm genesis is still not rigorously understood in this CPG, mainly because it is made of neurons with irregular intrinsic activity. Using mathematical models we addressed the question of using a network of irregularly behaving elements to generate periodic oscillations, and we show some advantages of using non-periodic neurons with intrinsic behavior in the transition from bursting to tonic spiking (as found in biological pyloric CPGs) as building components. We studied two- and three-neuron model CPGs built either with Hindmarsh-Rose or with conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-like model neurons. By changing a model's parameter we could span the neuron's intrinsic dynamical behavior from slow periodic bursting to fast tonic spiking, passing through a transition where irregular bursting was observed. Two-neuron CPG, half center oscillator (HCO), was obtained for each intrinsic behavior of the neurons by coupling them with mutual symmetric synaptic inhibition. Most of these HCOs presented regular antiphasic bursting activity and the changes of the bursting frequencies was studied as a function of the inhibitory synaptic strength. Among all HCOs, those made of intrinsic irregular neurons presented a wider burst frequency range while keeping a reliable regular oscillatory (bursting) behavior. HCOs of periodic neurons tended to be either hard to change their behavior with synaptic strength variations (slow periodic burster neurons) or unable to perform a physiologically meaningful rhythm (fast tonic spiking neurons). Moreover, 3-neuron CPGs with connectivity and output similar to those of the pyloric CPG presented the same results.},

  abstract = {Central Pattern Generator (CPG) circuits are neural networks that generate rhythmic motor patterns. These circuits are typically built of half-center oscillator subcircuits with reciprocally inhibitory connections. Another common property in many CPGs is the remarkable rich spiking-bursting dynamics of their constituent cells, which balance robustness and flexibility to generate their joint coordinated rhythms. In this paper, we use conductance-based models and realistic connection topologies inspired by the crustacean pyloric CPG to address the study of asymmetry factors shaping CPG bursting rhythms. In particular, we assess the role of asymmetric maximal synaptic conductances, time constants and gap-junction connectivity to establish the regularity of half-center oscillator based CPGs. We map and characterize the synaptic parameter space that lead to regular and irregular bursting activity in these networks. The analysis indicates that asymmetric configurations display robust regular rhythms and that large regions of both regular and irregular but coordinated rhythms exist as a function of the asymmetry in the circuit. Our results show that asymmetry both in the maximal conductances and in the temporal dynamics of mutually inhibitory neurons can synergistically contribute to shape wide regimes of regular spiking-bursting activity in CPGs. Finally, we discuss how a closed-loop protocol driven by a regularity goal can be used to find and characterize regular regimes when there is not time to perform an exhaustive search, as in most experimental studies.},

Here we provide a review of the realistic simulation strategy and use the cerebellar network as an example. This network has been carefully investigated at molecular and cellular level and has been the object of intense theoretical investigation. The cerebellum is thought to lie at the core of the forward controller operations of the brain and to implement timing and sensory prediction functions. The cerebellum is well described and provides a challenging field in which one of the most advanced realistic microcircuit models has been generated.

  abstract = {Changes in temperature affect biochemical reaction rates and, consequently, neural processing. The nervous systems of poikilothermic animals must have evolved mechanisms enabling them to retain their functionality under varying temperatures. Auditory receptor neurons of grasshoppers respond to sound in a surprisingly temperature-compensated manner: firing rates depend moderately on temperature, with average Q10 values around 1.5. Analysis of conductance-based neuron models reveals that temperature compensation of spike generation can be achieved solely relying on cell-intrinsic processes and despite a strong dependence of ion conductances on temperature. Remarkably, this type of temperature compensation need not come at an additional metabolic cost of spike generation. Firing rate-based information transfer is likely to increase with temperature and we derive predictions for an optimal temperature dependence of the tympanal transduction process fostering temperature compensation. The example of auditory receptor neurons demonstrates how neurons may exploit single-cell mechanisms to cope with multiple constraints in parallel., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02078.001, Warm-blooded animals\textemdash{}including mammals and birds\textemdash{}expend large amounts of energy in keeping their body temperature constant regardless of how hot or cold their environment is. By contrast, the body temperature of cold-blooded animals\textemdash{}including amphibians, reptiles, and insects\textemdash{}follows that of their surroundings. Cold-blooded animals must therefore have evolved a means to cope with the effects of changes in temperature, but exactly how they do this is not clear., Now, Roemschied et al. have obtained new insights into this process by studying the nerve cells in grasshoppers that allow them to hear sounds. The auditory system of the grasshopper comprises sensory receptor neurons that are located on the abdomen of the insect. Sound waves move the tympanal membrane, which causes ion channels within the cell membranes to open. This enables the neurons to produce an electrical signal known as a spike., Recordings from grasshoppers revealed that changing the outside temperature by up to 10$^\circ$C affected the rate at which the neurons produced spikes by only about half the amount expected. Given that these neurons do not receive inputs from any other cells, this ability to withstand changes in temperature must be intrinsic to the neurons themselves. Consistent with this, computational modeling showed that while the activity of individual ion channels did indeed vary with changes in temperature, these changes in ion channel activity had little overall effect on the rate at which a neuron produced spikes., Whereas it has previously been assumed that compensation for changes in temperature occurs at the level of networks of neurons, the work of Roemschied et al. reveals that such compensation can occur in individual cells, and that it need not require a lot of energy to be expended., DOI:

  abstract = {Recent computational and experimental work has shown that similar network performance can result from variable sets of synaptic and intrinsic properties. Because temperature is a global perturbation that differentially influences every biological process within the nervous system, one might therefore expect that individual animals would respond differently to temperature. Nonetheless, the phase relationships of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis, are remarkably invariant between 7 and 23$^\circ$C (Tang et al., 2010). Here, we report that, when isolated STG preparations were exposed to more extreme temperature ranges, their networks became nonrhythmic, or "crashed", in a reversible fashion. Animals were acclimated for at least 3 weeks at 7, 11, or 19$^\circ$C. When networks from the acclimated animals were perturbed by acute physiologically relevant temperature ramps (11-23$^\circ$C), the network frequency and phase relationships were independent of the acclimation group. At high acute temperatures ($>$23$^\circ$C), circuits from the cold-acclimated animals produced less-regular pyloric rhythms than those from warm-acclimated animals. At high acute temperatures, phase relationships between pyloric neurons were more variable from animal to animal than at moderate acute temperatures, suggesting that individual differences across animals in intrinsic circuit parameters are revealed at high temperatures. This shows that individual and variable neuronal circuits can behave similarly in normal conditions, but their behavior may diverge when confronted with extreme external perturbations.},

  abstract = {Summary
Oscillations in neural activity are a prominent feature of many brain states. Individual hippocampal neurons exhibit intrinsic membrane potential oscillations and intrinsic resonance in the theta frequency range. We found that the subthreshold resonance frequency of CA1 pyramidal neurons was location dependent, varying more than 3-fold between the soma and the distal dendrites. Furthermore, activity- and NMDA-receptor-dependent long-term plasticity increased this resonance frequency through changes in h channel properties. The increase in resonance frequency and an associated reduction in excitability were nearly identical in the soma and the first 300 $\mu$m of the apical dendrites. These spatially widespread changes accompanying long-term synaptic potentiation also reduced the neuron's ability to elicit spikes evoked through a nonpotentiated synaptic pathway. Our results suggest that the frequency response of these neurons depends on the dendritic location of their inputs and that activity can regulate their response dynamics within an oscillating neural network.},

Evidence derived using optical imaging, molecular-genetic and optogenetic techniques in conjunction with appropriate behavioural analyses continues to offer support for the idea that changing the strength of connections between neurons is one of the major mechanisms by which engrams are stored in the brain.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Differences in ion channel composition endow different neuronal types with distinct computational properties. Understanding how these biophysical differences affect network-level computation is an important frontier. We focus on a set of biophysical properties, experimentally observed in developing cortical neurons, that allow these neurons to efficiently encode their inputs despite time-varying changes in the statistical context. Large-scale propagating waves are autonomously generated by the developing brain even before the onset of sensory experience. Using multi-layered feedforward networks, we examine how changes in intrinsic properties can lead to changes in the network's ability to represent and transmit information on multiple timescales. We demonstrate that measured changes in the computational properties of immature single neurons enable the propagation of slow-varying wave-like inputs. In contrast, neurons with more mature properties are more sensitive to fast fluctuations, which modulate the slow-varying information. While slow events are transmitted with high fidelity in initial network layers, noise degrades transmission in downstream network layers. Our results show how short-term adaptation and modulation of the neurons' input-output firing curves by background synaptic noise determine the ability of neural networks to transmit information on multiple timescales.},

  abstract = {Firing rate is an important means of encoding information in the nervous system. To reliably encode a wide range of signals, neurons need to achieve a broad range of firing frequencies and to move smoothly between low and high firing rates. This can be achieved with specific ionic currents, such as A-type potassium currents, which can linearize the frequency-input current curve. By applying recently developed mathematical tools to a number of biophysical neuron models, we show how currents that are classically thought to permit low firing rates can paradoxically cause a jump to a high minimum firing rate when expressed at higher levels. Consequently, achieving and maintaining a low firing rate is surprisingly difficult and fragile in a biological context. This difficulty can be overcome via interactions between multiple currents, implying a need for ion channel degeneracy in the tuning of neuronal properties.},

  shorttitle = {Driving Respiration},
  abstract = {1. The central pattern generator (CPG) for respiration is located in the brainstem and produces rhythmic synaptic drive for motoneurons controlling respiratory muscles. Based on respiratory nerve discharge, the respiratory cycle can be divided into three phases: inspiration, postinspiration and stage 2 expiration. 2. Six basic types of respiratory neuron participate in respiratory rhythmogenesis. Their firing and membrane potential patterns are locked to different phases of the respiratory cycle. 3. In adult mammals, respiratory neurons are subject to excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs and show extensive synaptic interconnections that are mainly inhibitory. There are differences in the relative importance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drives and the neurotransmitters involved in respiratory rhythmogenesis in neonates compared with adults. 4. Respiratory neurons possess a number of intrinsic membrane currents that may be involved in central pattern generation, including low- and high-voltage-activated calcium, potassium, calcium-dependent potassium, sodium and mixed cationic currents. More quantitative information is needed about the distribution and characteristics of these ionic currents if we are to understand rhythmogenesis. 5. The two main theories for the origin of respiratory rhythm are those of pacemaker neuron-driven and synaptic network-driven CPG. Evidence derived from in vivo and in vitro experiments exists to support both of these theories. There may be a significant switch in the underlying mechanism driving the respiratory CPG during postnatal development.},

  abstract = {The neuropeptide, red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH), strengthened the inhibitory synapse from the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron to the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons in the pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster, Homarus americanus. RPCH produced several-fold increases in the amplitude of both action potential\textendash{}mediated and non\textendash{}impulse-mediated transmission that persisted for as long as the peptide remained present. Because the LP to PD synapse is the only feedback to the pacemaker kernel of the pyloric network, which consists of the electrically coupled two PD neurons and the anterior burster (AB) neuron, it might have been expected that strengthening the LP to PD synapse would increase the period of the pyloric rhythm. However, the period of the pyloric rhythm increased only transiently in RPCH, and a transient increase in cycle period was observed even when the LP neuron was hyperpolarized. Phase response curves were measured using the dynamic clamp to create artificial inhibitory inputs of variable strength and duration to the PD neurons. Synaptic conductance values seen in normal saline were ineffective at changing the pyloric period throughout the pyloric cycle. Conductances similar to those seen in 10-6 M RPCH also did not evoke phase resets at phases when the LP neuron is typically active. Thus the dramatic effects of RPCH on synaptic strength have little role in modulation of the period of the pyloric rhythm under normal operating conditions but may help to stabilize the rhythm when the cycle period is too slow or too fast.},
